# PLAGIARISM AND AI
## Overview and Origin
* Turnitin LLC.
* Incorporated in 1998.
* Founded by John Barrie and Christian Storm
* Turnitin was originally an online peer-review project.
* Educational institutions pay an annual fee based on size of instituion and number of students.

## Business Activities
* Turnitin is a plagiarism detection service. Now focused on countering use of generative AI in schools.
* Turnitin's main customer are academic institutions as well as hiring agencies as it rolls out it's resume checking service iThenticate.
* According to bue.libguides.com, as of 2023 Turnitin claimed to have a "...database of 200 million archived student papers, 17 billion web pages crawled, 90,000 journals, periodicals & books." (<a href="https://bue.libguides.com/Turnitin2_Students/ContactTurnitinAdministrators#:~:text=Turnitin%20has%20a%20huge%20database,90%2C000%20journals%2C%20periodicals%20%26%20books">bue.libguides.com</a>)
* Turnitin works directly with academic institutions giving them an edge over their competitors who are either a free service or subscription-based. By having students and teachers submitting work directly to their database they have put themselves at the heart of the plagiarism debate.
* Turnitin uses Natural Language Processing for text analysis and to detect similarities. Turnitin breaks down text into groups of sentences which are then analyzed by their AI detection software. Because AIs such as ChatGPT are also NLP, ChatGPT tries to predict the next most likely phrase to be used. Turnitin does the same and flags anything that comes up as a match.

## Landscape
* Turnitin is in education and plagiarism detection. 
* The major trends in the industry in the last ten years have been rise of Natural Language Processing AIs such as ChatGPT which is now accessible to your average student. In 2014, Turnitin began investing in machine learning and acquired Lightside Labs. (<a herf="https://www.turnitin.com/about/">turnitin.com/about</a>)
* The leading companies in the field are Grammerly, Unicheck, Quetext, Scribrr, and Plagamme. 

## Results
* The business impact of Turnitin has been extensive. The regular use of AI in schools and universities has created a need for safeguards and Turnitin has positioned themselves to be those safeguards. 
* While all these companies offer very similar services, it is Turnitin's direct partnership with so many educational institutions that gives it the advantage. Turnitin is able to grow its database directly from these institutions themselves.

## Recommendations

* If I were to advise Turnitin on what services or products would be beneficial, I would suggest hiring a PR firm to publicly explain the benefits of Turnitin. A lot of the scrutiny the company faces lands in the moral and ethical side of things. Students and teachers have raised concerns over numerous aspects of the Turnitin format leading to several univeristies to cease it's service.
* In 2023, Vanderbilt Univerity decided to end the use of Turnitin and laid out the reasons in this article. (Vanderbilt) Many of these reasons have been echoed across academia. Here are the main points laid out by Michael Coley of Vanderbilt Univeristy:
    * Turnitin has a 1% false positive rate. According to Coley, if Vanderbilt submitted the 75,000 papers from it's 2022 academic year to Turnitin, 750 would be falsely labeled as writtin by AI.
    * Turnitin will often label papers written by non-english speaks as AI-generated. In a study released by Stanford University, they found: <blockquote cite="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-detectors-biased-against-non-native-english-writers"> "...detectors were “near-perfect” in evaluating essays written by U.S.-born eighth-graders, they classified more than half of TOEFL essays (61.22%) written by non-native English students as AI-generated (TOEFL is an acronym for the Test of English as a Foreign Language)." (Myers, 2023) </blockquote>
    * Turnitin has yet to give any detailed information on how it exactly determines if a paper is AI-generated. On the Turnitin company website they explain the way they break down text for it's AI recognition software but it's source code remains proprietary. 
* Another piece of advice I would offer Turnitin would be to <i>invest heavily into other NLP companies</i>. As long as AIs like ChatGPT continue to advance, there will be a need for Turnitin.
